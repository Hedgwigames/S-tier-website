    <p>S tier has currently had 7 Tournament formats: Bracket, SABC draft, SABC random, Strikeout, Timed solos (retired), Draft and 50%. Each one requires different skills and some luck to win in these games</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Bracket</h3>
    <p>Your usual format, sign up with a specified team size, play against other teams and the most points earned in that round wins. Knock out other teams and become the best of the server! In some cases, there is a losers bracket in the top 8 or 16. If you lose from then onwards, you are given another chance to win. The loser bracket finalist winner will play the winner bracket finalist winner, where the loser bracket team must win twice in a row to win the grand final.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>SABC draft and random</h3>
    <p>Each player will recieve a skill tier, decided by the players or the staff before the tournament. In the draft format, the S tiers will cycle through the players, selecting players back and forth until they all have a team of 4, 1 of each tier. In the random format, the players will be assigned using a random wheel, 1 of each tier. They are then put into the bracket format and fight it out until there is a winner.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Strikeout</h3>
    <p>This is a much different format to the others, post qualifying it is a small tourney, each tournament has a theme and tasks must be completed to progress. The last player is eliminated every round. These tasks are based on the theme and are assigned until a winner is revealed.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Timed solos (retired)</h3>
    <p>Everyone gets a time period (around 90 mins) to get their best 10 games on the server. These are then counted at the end and a winner is revealed. This format was retired after a negative reception as it didn't feel as fun as a bracket format etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Draft</h3>
    <p>Team captains are picked (the top players) and they will rotate choosing a player from an unsorted list of players. This is then repeated until they all have teams</p>
    <br>
    <h3>50%</h3>
    <p>Each team plays 3 games and uploads them. Each team's score is counted and the bottom 50% are eliminated from the tournament. Similar to a bracket, it will half each time.</p>
